"""
kill_switch.py – one-tap trading pause, controlled from the dashboard.

When the switch is ON ("paused"):
  * no NEW contract is ever bought (hard-blocked inside every buy function
    in deriv_client.py, plus a clean early-exit in bot_engine.py);
  * contracts that are already open are left alone and settle normally;
  * the bot stays connected and the dashboard keeps updating.

The state survives redeploys (this bot redeploys itself on a schedule): it
is mirrored into this service's own KILL_SWITCH env var through the same
Render-API mechanism fixed_cycle.py already uses, and read back at boot.
Without RENDER_API_KEY the switch still works, but only until the next
redeploy — the dashboard says so.

Security: the dashboard URL is public, so toggling requires a PIN. With no
extra setup the PIN is the LAST 6 CHARACTERS OF YOUR DERIV_API_TOKEN (you
type it once per browser; it is remembered on that device). Set
DASHBOARD_PIN if you would rather use your own.
